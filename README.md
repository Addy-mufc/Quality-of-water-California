# Quality-of-water-California

This is a research project as part of the coursework at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Research Question: Does the Water Quality Vary Between Modoc County, CA and Santa Clara County, CA?

The research question is: Does the water quality vary between Modoc County, CA and Santa Clara County, CA? We chose this research question because we wanted to know if water quality would vary between a rich and poor region in the United States. Modoc County, CA and Santa Clara County, CA represent our chosen economic focus because of their respective differences in median home price. Modoc County, CA has a median home price of $192,800 while Santa Clara County has a median home price of $1,296,980. 

The research question is important because it allows us to understand matters of inequities in the United States. People living in areas with poor water quality might suffer from poor health outcomes and increased rates of illnesses. We believe that people deserve to know if the water quality in their area is insufficient and that people deserve to know if low-income people will bear the brunt of these inequities due to their places of residence.


Data was collected from several sources which includes:

1. National Association of Realtors
2. California Open Data Portal

A dataset was created after merging data from various sources, cleaning it and refining it for anaylsis.

The two sample t-test was used to test whether the unknown population means of two groups are equal or not.
